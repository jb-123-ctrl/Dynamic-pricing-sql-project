# Dynamic Pricing Strategy Analysis using MySQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes product pricing and demand data to design a dynamic pricing strategy using SQL.
The goal is to help businesses decide when to increase prices, maintain prices, or apply discounts based on demand patterns.

## Tools Used
- MySQL 8.0
- DB Fiddle (Online MySQL Environment)
- GitHub

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Product details
- Base price and selling price
- Demand
- Region and sale date

## Key Analysis Performed
- Demand vs Price analysis
- Profit calculation
- Demand-based pricing strategy using CASE
- Category-wise pricing insights
- Region-wise demand analysis

## Dynamic Pricing Logic
